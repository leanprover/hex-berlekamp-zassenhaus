# Streaming direct combinations

No list of subset/complement pairs is materialized.  The iterator carries the
selected and rejected prefixes in reverse, plus the cheap candidate statistics,
and stops at the first exact divisor.  The proved classical search uses the
head-forced iterator; the proposal tier uses the unforced low-cardinality
iterator.

Three properties keep the traversal off a rejected support's back.
`SupportMeta` records the lift modulus, each lifted factor's degree and trailing
coefficient, and the target's word-prime image once, so a traversal step is an
array read and one modular multiply rather than a fresh `p ^ k` and a fresh
`Option`.  Every leaf runs its metadata-only filters before it reverses the
selected indices, maps them to lifted polynomials, or concatenates the
complementary support -- the last of which is built only once an exact divisor
is in hand.  And a leaf that does build a candidate puts it to the finite-field
divisibility obstruction, which rejects in machine-word arithmetic what would
otherwise cost a multi-limb integer long division.

A rejected leaf still pays for the metadata-only filters themselves, which are
modular arithmetic on the lift modulus; what it no longer pays for is the
support representation, and -- past the filters -- the exact division.

/-- Traversal metadata for one lifted basis against one target, computed once
per sweep.

The lift modulus is `basis.p ^ basis.k`, which at recovery precision is wide
enough to need several limbs, and rebuilding it at every traversal step is the
dominant cost of a support that no candidate test ever sees.  It is recorded
prepared, in every representation the traversal reduces against: the residue
update multiplies modulo its integer form and the trailing filter compares
against its halfway threshold, so neither derives anything from the modulus at
a leaf.  The word-prime image of the target is the other value a leaf needs and
no leaf should recompute.  The proof fields pin the arrays to the lifted factors
elementwise and to their length, so a traversal reading this metadata is
interchangeable with one reading the factors directly. -/
