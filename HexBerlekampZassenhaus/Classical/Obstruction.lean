# A finite-field obstruction to integer divisibility

Reduction modulo a prime `q` is a ring homomorphism `ℤ[X] → 𝔽_q[X]`, so it
carries divisibility forward: a divisor of the recombination target reduces to a
divisor of the reduced target, and `𝔽_q[X]` division then leaves no remainder.
Contrapositively, a nonzero remainder is a *proof* that the candidate does not
divide, obtained in machine-word arithmetic rather than by dividing multi-limb
integer polynomials.

The obstruction is one-sided.  A zero remainder says nothing: exact integer
division remains the only accepting test, and the traversal falls through to it
unchanged.  The divisor's image is allowed to be zero or to lose its leading
coefficient; `mod_eq_zero_of_dvd` covers those cases uniformly, so there is no
"inconclusive" branch to get wrong.

/-- The fixed word-sized prime carrying the divisibility obstruction.

Any prime below `2 ^ 31` satisfies `ZMod64.Bounds`; `2 ^ 26 - 5` is large enough
that an accidental zero remainder costs at most one exact division that would
have been performed anyway, and small enough that its trial-division primality
proof is cheap to check in the kernel. -/
