Remove the initial zero-coefficient run from a dense integer polynomial.

Dense coefficients are stored in ascending degree order, so the initial zero
run is exactly the executable power of `X` dividing the polynomial.

Executable test that a field-polynomial gcd is a unit.

Choose a small admissible prime for the Berlekamp-Zassenhaus computation.

The search is bounded to a fixed ascending list of small primes. Candidate
scores use the currently available executable modular factor surface; strict
score improvement replaces the incumbent, so equal scores keep the smaller
earlier prime.
