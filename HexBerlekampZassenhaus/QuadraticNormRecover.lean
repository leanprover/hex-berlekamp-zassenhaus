# Recovering an iterated-quadratic-norm certificate

{name}`Hex.QuadraticNormCertificate.check` is the trusted half: it decides, by
integer arithmetic alone, whether a translation and a list of radicands prove
its input irreducible. This module is the *untrusted* half, the search that
proposes the pair. Nothing here carries a proof obligation, because a wrong
proposal dies in the check; the only thing the search owes is that it is cheap
when it is going to fail.

**The closed form.** Summing `exp(t·α_ε)` over the `2ⁿ` sign patterns gives
`2ⁿ · ∏ᵢ cosh(t√dᵢ)`, so writing `p_k` for the power sums of the roots of the
centred polynomial `f(X + c)` and `u_k = p_{2k} / (2ⁿ · (2k)!)`, the series
`∑_k u_k sᵏ` equals `∏ᵢ C(dᵢ·s)` with `C(z) = cosh √z = ∑_j zʲ/(2j)!`. Taking
logarithms turns the product into a sum: the coefficient of `sᵏ` in
`log C(z)` is a nonzero rational `γ_k` independent of the input, so writing
`L_k` for the coefficient of `sᵏ` in `log ∑_k u_k sᵏ`,

    ∑ᵢ dᵢᵏ = L_k / γ_k,   k = 1, …, n.

Newton's identities turn those power sums into `∏ᵢ (y - dᵢ)`, whose integer
roots are the radicands. Every step is exact rational arithmetic on the top
`2n + 1` coefficients of `f`, and `∑ᵢ dᵢ²` bounds each `|dᵢ|`, which bounds the
root search.

**Failing cheaply.** A polynomial outside the class is refused at the first
structural test it meets: degree not a power of two, a leading coefficient
outside `{1, -1}`, `2ⁿ ∤ a_{N-1}`, a non-integral intermediate, a radicand
bound past `radicandBound`, or too few
integer roots. Most of a factorization corpus dies at the degree test.

/-- Modular support width at or above which the certificate is attempted.

Recombination at width `w` walks up to `2 ^ (w - 1)` supports, so the gate is
stated as a width rather than as a node count: at the floor the walk is
`2 ^ 15 = 32768` nodes, an eighth of the `Hex.defaultSubsetBudget` the
recombination already carries, and it is the cost of that walk the certificate
is worth attempting to replace. Below the floor a row pays exactly nothing,
because nothing is constructed.

The floor is deliberately *not* `defaultSubsetBudget` itself. A width-16 walk
sits far under that budget and would never trip it, yet width 16 is where the
walk first costs tens of milliseconds -- three orders of magnitude above the
worst measured cost of a certificate that fails to apply. -/

/-! ## Sanity checks

Interpreted, which is how the search is reached in practice: the `factor_poly`
and `irreducibility` tactics call `Hex.ZPoly.factorize` from a `meta def` at
elaboration time and emit a certificate check, so nothing here is ever asked to
reduce in the kernel. Rational recovery would not: `Rat` division goes through
`Nat.gcd`, which the kernel does not unfold. -/

/-- Does the budget-gated iterated-quadratic-norm certificate prove `core`
irreducible?

`width` is the number of modular factors, known once the modular factorization
is in hand. Below {name}`Hex.QuadraticNormCertificate.widthFloor` the answer is
`false` with nothing constructed, so a row that recombines cheaply pays nothing
for the attempt. Above it, {name}`Hex.QuadraticNormCertificate.recover?`
proposes a translation and radicands and
{name}`Hex.QuadraticNormCertificate.check` decides them; a failure at either
step is an ordinary `false` carrying no state.

**Normalization.** Every `F(c; d)` is monic, so the certificate applies to
`core` exactly when `core` has leading coefficient `1` or `-1`, and the only
normalization is negation: `-1` is a unit of `ℤ[X]`, so `core` and `-core` are
irreducible together. There is no scaling and no content division, because a
primitive integer polynomial with leading coefficient outside `{1, -1}` is
never `± F(c; d)`; {name}`Hex.ZPoly.normalizePrimitiveSign`, inside the check,
is that negation and nothing else. -/
