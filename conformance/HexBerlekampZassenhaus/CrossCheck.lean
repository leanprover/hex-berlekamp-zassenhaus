BHKS fast-path vs slow-backstop cross-check for `HexBerlekampZassenhaus`.

Oracle: none (Tier-G fast-vs-fast)
Mode: always

`SPEC/Libraries/hex-berlekamp-zassenhaus.md` pins the production fast path
to the van Hoeij/BHKS CLD lattice, with exhaustive subset recombination
retained only as the slow backstop.  This module operationalises that
contract: for each fixture polynomial we run `factorTrial`, and when
fixed-precision `bhksRecover?` returns `some` on the committed lifted-factor
set we check that the certified fast result preserves the same input product.
If fixed-precision recovery returns `none`, the fast path has made no
correctness claim; that is an allowed miss for this Lean-only cross-check.

Fixtures cover lifted-factor counts `n ∈ {3, 4, 5}`.  Most fixture
polynomials are products of distinct integer linear factors with roots fitting
inside the centred residue range for the shared lift modulus `37 ^ 2 = 1369`,
so the linear factors are themselves valid `mod p^k` representatives.  A
separate adversarial fixture uses four Hensel-lifted linear factors whose
expected integer factors are two quadratic subset products.  The fixtures
therefore double as ground truth: every accepted fast or slow factor multiset
must reproduce the input polynomial, and the adversarial fast result must match
the committed factor buckets.
