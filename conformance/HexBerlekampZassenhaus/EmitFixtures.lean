JSONL emit driver for the `hex-berlekamp-zassenhaus` oracle.

`lake exe hexbz_emit_fixtures` writes one fixture record plus one
`result` record per case to `stdout` (or to `$HEX_FIXTURE_OUTPUT` when
set).  The companion oracle driver `scripts/oracle/bz_flint.py` reads
the same stream and re-runs the integer factorisation through
python-flint's `fmpz_poly.factor()` for cross-check.  A small number of
cases also carry optional pinned modular-factor metadata so the oracle
checks that the committed input has the intended split over a named
prime.

Fixtures are integer polynomials at degrees 4, 6, 8, 10, 16, 18, 20, and 28,
covering the supported factorization shapes:

* scalar/sign edge cases from the public `Factorization` convention,
* already-irreducible Mignotte-bounded polynomials (cyclotomic
  `Φ_p` for `p ∈ {5, 7, 11, 17}`),
* reducible products whose current output is already fully refined into
  irreducible components,
* polynomials with content greater than `1`,
* the degree-20 `Φ_11 · Φ_22` reducible product,
* adversarial cases where mod-p factors split more finely than the integer
  factorisation; see "Adversarial modular-split coverage" below.
* original-coordinate M1 acceptance on a reducible Chebyshev input and on an
  irreducible Legendre input requiring the two-prime degree certificate.

# Adversarial modular-split coverage

The corpus includes inputs where integer factorisation requires a non-trivial
subset product of lifted mod-p factors and inputs that split into at least four
distinct mod-p factors over a small admissible prime. Four `adv/*` cases carry pinned
`modFactorPrime` / `modFactorDegrees` metadata so the oracle independently
verifies the named modular split:

* `adv/quad_sqrt2_sqrt3` — `(X² − 2)(X² − 3)` splits over F₂₃ as four
  linear factors that recombine into two integer quadratics
  (non-trivial subset product, heavy split over a small admissible prime).
* `adv/x4_plus_1` — `X⁴ + 1`, irreducible over ℤ, splits over F₅ as
  two quadratics (subset-product over a small admissible prime).
* `adv/swinnerton_dyer_sd3` — degree-8 Swinnerton-Dyer SD₃, irreducible
  over ℤ, splits completely as eight linear factors over F₇₁
  (heavy split).
* `adv/phi15` — Φ₁₅, irreducible over ℤ, splits completely as eight
  linear factors over F₃₁ (heavy split, small admissible prime).

# Lattice-method coverage

Two corpus cases can be answered **only by the lattice method**, one for each
lattice result:

* `adv/swinnerton_dyer_sd5_pair` — `SD₅(x)·SD₅(x+1)` (degree 64, the
  two true factors are the 32-blocks `SD₅(x)` and `SD₅(x+1)`) exercises
  the **split** arm: CLD recovery separates the two 32-blocks at modest
  precision.
* `adv/multiquadratic_nonnorm_64` — the minimal polynomial of
  √2+√3+√5+√7+√11+√13+√6 (degree 64, content 1, irreducible over ℤ)
  exercises the **irreducibility-certification** arm: recovery converges
  to the single all-ones class and the certificate-backed early stop
  returns the original polynomial without grinding to the `bhksBound` cap.
  This element generates the same degree-64 multiquadratic field as SD₆,
  so it too splits into quadratics modulo every admissible prime, but its
  conjugates are `±√2 ±√3 ±√5 ±√7 ±√11 ±√13 ± √6` with the last sign
  *determined* by the first two. It is therefore **not** an iterated
  quadratic norm, the recognizer of the next section correctly refuses
  it, and the lattice answers. That refusal is the point of the case: it
  is the adversarial twin of `adv/swinnerton_dyer_sd6`.

Multiquadratic fields split into factors of degree ≤ 2 modulo every
admissible (squarefree-image) prime, so the lifted-factor count is
`r ≥ 32` no matter which prime the selector picks (at the selected
primes, 29 and 19, all blocks are quadratic and `r = 32`), and the
size-ordered classical search would need ΣC(31,≤15) ≈ 2³⁰ subset
candidates to reach its half-size frontier. For `sd5_pair` that is
where the two 16-block factors live, and for `multiquadratic_nonnorm_64`
that is what exhausting all nontrivial subset products takes. This is far past
the direct classical candidate budget, so it declines before starting an
incomplete cardinality level and the hybrid falls through to the van Hoeij CLD
lattice arm. Both cases emit the
*hybrid* trace (`factorTraced`) rather than the classical one. The emit helper
rejects a run unless the lattice method answered, while the committed trace records
`method = "lattice"`, `declined = true`, the prime, and `r = 32`. Since each
remainder is lifted independently, the classical trace reports
`subsetCandidates = 0`; the separate wall-clock benchmark detects excessive
recombination work. The `bz_trace_gate.py` baseline also checks the method,
decline status, and candidate-count bound.
There is deliberately no `#guard` twin in `Conformance.lean` --
elaboration-time interpretation of the lattice run would cost minutes
of build time; the compiled emit executable covers it in seconds.

# Certificate coverage

`adv/swinnerton_dyer_sd6` — SD₆ (degree 64, minimal polynomial of
√2+√3+√5+√7+√11+√13, irreducible over ℤ) is answered by the
iterated-quadratic-norm certificate. At `r = 32` the width floor opens the
gate, recovery reads the radicands `2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13` and the translation `0`
off the top coefficients, and the check confirms both independence and the
coefficientwise identity, so the whole square-free core is returned as one
irreducible factor with no Hensel lift. Its helper requires
`method = "quadraticNorm"` and no classical decline. Unlike the lattice cases
its `classicalFactor` result is emitted rather than skipped, because the
certificate answers on the classical entry point itself.

# Checked-proposal replay coverage

`regression/split_roots_1_24` has 24 lifted linear factors. The total selector
routes it through unforced exact peeling and then replays the proved classical
factorizer on every exact piece. Its helper requires `method = "replay"` and a
`largeSupport` routing decline. The separately emitted classical result is
deliberately skipped for this sentinel; nearby split-root cases continue to
cover the unrestricted public classical entry point.

# Cross-checked operation

* `factor` — `Hex.ZPoly.factorize` from `HexBerlekampZassenhaus` (the
  default-bound public entry point).  Lean serialises the resulting
  `Factorization` as `[scalar, [[coeffs, multiplicity], ...]]`;
  python-flint cross-checks each reported nonconstant component directly
  against `flint.fmpz_poly.factor()` on the input polynomial.  The oracle
  does not re-factor Lean output components, so reducible components are
  reported as conformance failures.

The fixture set is committed under
`conformance-fixtures/HexBerlekampZassenhaus/bz.jsonl` and is
intentionally small.  Coordinate any future case-id additions with
`HexBerlekampZassenhaus/Conformance.lean` and the oracle script
so identical ids stay in sync.

/-! # Lattice-method coverage

See the module docstring section "Lattice-method coverage". The cases are
emitted through the public `factorize` path (`factorTraced`, whose `.1`
is `factorize`) so the pinned trace catches method regressions, not just
lattice ones. -/

/-- The two lattice-only cases, one per lattice answer arm:

* `adv/swinnerton_dyer_sd5_pair` (split arm) — `SD₅(x)·SD₅(x+1)`, the
  product of Swinnerton-Dyer SD₅ (the committed scheduled-corpus
  `adv/swinnerton_dyer_5` polynomial, minimal polynomial of
  √2+√3+√5+√7+√11) with its shift by one.  Degree 64, content 1, exactly
  two integer factors (the two 32-blocks).
* `adv/swinnerton_dyer_sd6` (certification arm) — Swinnerton-Dyer SD₆
  (the committed corpus `sd6` polynomial, minimal polynomial of
  √2+√3+√5+√7+√11+√13).  Degree 64, content 1, irreducible over ℤ. -/

recovered certificate is the translation `0` with radicands

single `factorTraced` run supplies the `factorize` result (its `.1` is the
public `factorize`) **and** the trace, so the committed trace pins the method
`factorize` actually used.  The helper is sentinel-only: it errors out unless the
classical method declined and the lattice method answered, which is the case's
purpose: a case that stops using the lattice method must not emit
quietly. A method change also breaks the committed-fixture byte comparison and
the `bz_trace_gate.py` baseline. Since the
lattice method answered, the classical method returned `none`, so
`classicalFactor` is `null` (an oracle skip) without paying the classical
decline burn a second time.  The exact `prime` / `r` / `subsetCandidates`
values are pinned by the committed-fixture byte-diff in
`scripts/ci/run_oracles.sh`; the trace-gate baseline additionally pins
method/decline and upper-bounds `subsetCandidates`. -/
